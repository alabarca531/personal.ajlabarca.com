## Advanced Atmospheric Research

RAAVEN is a specialized research aircraft designed to study atmospheric conditions in extreme environments. These unmanned aircraft systems are capable of flying in severe weather conditions that would be dangerous for traditional manned aircraft.

**Mission Capabilities:**

- Atmospheric data collection
- Weather pattern analysis
- Environmental monitoring
- Storm system research
- Climate science support

The aircraft's robust design allows it to gather critical scientific data that helps researchers better understand weather patterns, climate change, and atmospheric phenomena. These images capture the RAAVEN during various phases of its research missions over Colorado's diverse terrain.
